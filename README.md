## 🧠 More about me

I’ve always been fascinated by one question: **why?** Why do things work the way they do and how can we make them better?

My main interests sit at the intersection of **AI and cloud**, and how they’re transforming the world through **automation**, **coding**, and **smarter decision-making**. I love exploring new AI tools across a multitude of sectors and seeing how they reshape workflows across different industries.

Outside of tech, I’m just as driven by fitness. Recently, I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by competing in **HYROX Doubles**, a team-based endurance event that keeps me uncomfortable (in the best way), improving, and learning at the same time. 🔥
